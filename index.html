       <font size="4">
      <p>Shilpi is a student of 1st std. She studies in ‘School of recursion’.</p>

      <p>She sits with her friends on the last bench of the classroom.  She think of a question: hey, how many rows are there in this classroom?</p>

      <p>She couldn’t see the rows by herself. What she should do?</p>

      <p>She has an idea, if she knows how many rows are there in front of her, she could add 1 to that (for counting the last row she is in) and then get the number of rows in the classroom.</p>
      <p>So she asks her friend Gagan who is sitting in the next row in front of her.</p>
      <p>Gagan thinks that just like Shilpi she also doesn’t know the number of rows in front of him, but if the person in the next row can tell how many rows are there in front of that person, he could simply add 1 and tell Shilpi how many rows are there in front of him.</p>

      <p>The next person also does the same thing. At last Shilpi’s question ‘How many rows are there in front of me?’ reaches to the student Ravi who is sitting in the first row, this time Ravi has the answer. Ravi says ‘There are zero rows in front of me’. He tells this to the student, Shubham who asked him the question, now Shubham thinks that if Ravi is sitting in front of me and he has 0 rows in front of him, that means that there is only 1 row in front of me.</p>

      <p>He passes this answer to the student who asked him the question. And that student does the same and so on…
      Lastly the Gagan tells Shilpi that there are 10 rows in front of him. After knowing this, Shilpi knows that there are 11 rows in front of her (including the one Gagan is on).</p>

      <p>This means, she says that there are total 12 rows in this classroom (11 + 1 the last row she is sitting on).</p>

      <p>This process we call is recursion. It means solving a problem by breaking it into smaller size problem.</p>
